# RL-Tick-Based-Trading-Agent
This project implements a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent for algorithmic trading, designed to operate on real-time tick and K-line market data using the Binance exchange API. The agent is trained using the PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) algorithm from Stable Baselines3 within a custom Gymnasium environment.
